Fitting the scenery:

Unzip or copy all files in the folder: Flightgear -> data -> Scenery -> Objects -> w070n10 -> w064n17.
Note that you have to replace the stg-file "1907438" otherwise the scenery won't work later.


Important: please be sure that you have installed the main scenery w070n10 before.    

If you did all how described so far now you can enjoy many flights to the Junacho E. Yrausquin Airport.
