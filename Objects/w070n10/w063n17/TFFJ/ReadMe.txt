TFFJ - St. Barts Airport
------------------------

How to install the scenery?

Copy or unzip all files and put it in the following folder:
Flightgear -> data -> Scenery -> Objects -> w070n10 -> w063n17

Be sure that you replace the stg-file named "1923808" otherwise it won't work later.

Have fun with many flights to St Barts Airport.
